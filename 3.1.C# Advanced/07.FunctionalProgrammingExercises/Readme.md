                      Adasha      |

Knights of Honor
----------------

Write a program that reads a collection of **names** as **strings** from
the **console** then appends “**Sir**” in front of every name and
**prints** it back onto the **console**. Use **Action&lt;T&gt;**.

### Examples

| **Input**                       | **Output**       |

Custom Min Function
-------------------

Write a simple program that reads from the **console** a set of
**integers** and **prints** back onto the **console** the **smallest**
**number** from the collection. Use **Func&lt;T, T&gt;**.

### Examples

| **Input**      | **Output** |
|----------------|------------|
| 1 4 3 2 1 7 13 | 1          |

Find Evens or Odds
------------------

You are given a lower and an upper bound for a range of integer numbers.
Then a command specifies if you need to list all even or odd numbers in
the given range. Use **Predicate&lt;T&gt;**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output**        |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 10      
            
 odd        | 1 3 5 7 9         |

 even       | 20 22 24 26 28 30 |

Applied Arithmetics
-------------------

Write a program that executes some mathematical operations on a given
collection. On the **first line** you are given **a list of numbers**.
On the **next lines** you are passed **different commands** that you
need to **apply to all numbers** in the list: "add" -&gt; add 1 to each
number; "multiply" -&gt; multiply each number by 2; "subtract" -&gt;
subtract 1 from each number; “print” -&gt; print the collection. The
input will end with an "**end**" command. Use functions.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 
            
 add

 print      
            
 end        | 3 4 5 6 7  |
| 5 10      
            
 multiply   
            
 subtract   
            
 print      
            
 end        | 9 19       |

Reverse and Exclude
-------------------

Write a program that reverses a collection and removes elements that are
divisible by a given integer **n**. Use predicates/functions.

### Examples

| **Input**         | **Output**  |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 6

 3                  | 50 40 10 20 |

Predicate for Names
-------------------

Write a program that filters a list of names according to their length.
On the first line you will be given integer **n** representing name
length. On the second line you will be given some names as strings
separated by space. Write a function that prints only the names whose
length is **less than or equal** to **n**.

### Examples

| **Input**                   | **Output** |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| 4

Custom Comparator
-----------------

Write a custom comparator that sorts all even numbers before all odd
ones in ascending order. Pass it to an Array.Sort() function and print
the result. Use functions.

### Examples

| **Input**   | **Output**  |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 4 6 1 3 5 |
| -3 2        | 2 -3        |

List of Predicates
------------------

Find all numbers in the range 1...N that are divisible by the numbers of
a given sequence. On the first line you will be given an integer **N** –
which is the end of the range. On the second line you will be given a
sequence of integers which are the dividers. Use predicates/functions.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output**      |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 10        
            
 1 1 1 2    | 2 4 6 8 10      |

 2 5 10 20  | 20 40 60 80 100 |

Predicate Party!
----------------

Ivancho’s parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning
an epic party at home. Unfortunately, his organizational skills are next
to non-existent so you are given the task to help him with the
reservations.

On the **first line** you get a **list with all the people** that are
coming. On the **next lines**, until you get the **"Party!" command**,
you may be asked to **double** or **remove** **all the people** that
apply to given **criteria**. There are **three different** **criteria**:
1. everyone that has his **name** **starting** with a **given string**;
2. everyone that has a **name** **ending** with a **given string**; 3.
everyone that has a **name** with a **given length**.

Finally **print all the guests** who are going to the party **separated
by** “, ” and then **add the ending** “are going to the party!”. If
there are **no guests** going to the party print “Nobody is going to the
party!”. See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input**              | **Output**                                         |

 Party!                  | Nobody is going to the party!                      |

Party Reservation Filter Module
-------------------------------

You need to implement a filtering module to a party reservation
software. First, to the Party Reservation Filter Module (PRFM for short)
is **passed a list** with invitations. Next the PRFM receives a
**sequence of commands** that specify whether you need to add or remove
a given filter.

Each PRFM command is in the given format **{command;filter type;filter
parameter}**

You can receive the following PRFM commands: "**Add filter**", "**Remove
filter**" or "**Print**". The possible PRFM filter types are: "**Starts
with**", "**Ends with**", "**Length**" and "**Contains**". All PRFM
filter parameters will be a string (or an integer only for the
“**Length”** filter). Each command will be valid e.g. you won’t be asked
to remove a non-existent filter.

The input will **end** with a "**Print**" command after which you should
print all the party-goers that are left after the filtration. See the
examples below:

### Examples

| **Input**                   | **Output** |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Pesho Misho Slav            
                              
 Add filter;Starts with;P     
                              
 Add filter;Starts with;M     
                              
 Print                        | Slav       |
| Pesho Misho Jica            
                              
 Add filter;Starts with;P     
                              
 Add filter;Starts with;M     
                              
 Remove filter;Starts with;M  
                              
 Print                        | Misho Jica |

Inferno III
-----------

On the **first line** you are given **a sequence of numbers**. Each
number is a gem and the **value** represents its **power**. On the next
lines, until you receive the "**Forge**" command, you will be receiving
commands in the following format: **{command;filter type;filter
parameter}.**

**Commands** can be: "**Exclude**", "**Reverse**" or "**Forge**". The
possible filter types are: "**Sum Left**", "**Sum Right**" and "**Sum
Left** **Right**". All filter **parameters** will be **an integer**.

"**Exclude**" marks a gem for **exclusion** from the set if it meets a
**given condition**. "**Reverse**" **deletes** a previous **exclusion**.

"**Sum Left**" tests if a gem’s **power** **added** to the gem standing
to **its** **left** gives a **certain value**. "**Sum Right**" is the
same but looks to a gem’s **right peer**. "**Sum Left Right**" sums the
gems power with **both** its **left** and **right** neighbors. If a gem
has **no neighbor** to its right or to its left (first or last element),
then simply **add 0** to the gem.

Note that **changes** to the sequence **are applied** only **after
forging**. This means that the gems are fixed at their positions and
**every function** occurs on the **original set**, so every gems power
is considered, no matter if it is marked to be excluded or not. To
better understand the problem, see the examples below:

TriFunction
-----------

Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the
**first name** whose sum of characters is **equal** to or **larger**
than a given number **N,** which will be given on the first line. Use a
function that **accepts another function** as one of its parameters.
Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the
program. Something along the lines of **Func&lt;string, int, bool&gt;**.
Afterwards create your main function which should accept the first
function as one of its parameters.
